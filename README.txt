generate_mdp.py can be used for generating an mdp specification which is then solved by planner.py

The mdp input parameters can be passed written in a rext file in the following format. 

Cr: [value1, value2]
Cb: [value1, value2]
Tr: [[value1, value2], [value3, value4]]
Tb: [[value1, value2], [value3, value4]]
